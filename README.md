TITLE:Image Encryption
DESCRIPTION:
 What Is Image Encryption?
Image encryption is the process of transforming image data into a format that cannot be understood or viewed without proper decryption. It ensures that even if someone gains unauthorized access to an image file (e.g., via the internet), they cannot view or make sense of it without the decryption key.

This is essential in securing sensitive or private visual data‚Äîlike personal photos, medical scans, classified documents, or surveillance footage.

üîç Why Encrypt Images?
Privacy ‚Äì Prevent unauthorized access to personal or sensitive images.

Security ‚Äì Protect against data breaches or eavesdropping during transmission (e.g., over the web).

Compliance ‚Äì Ensure adherence to laws and standards like GDPR, HIPAA, etc.

üîß How Does Image Encryption Work?
The process generally involves these steps:

Convert the image to binary or pixel data.

An image is just an array of pixel values (RGB values or grayscale).

Apply an encryption algorithm.

Algorithms like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), RSA, or custom techniques (e.g., pixel shuffling or chaotic systems) are used.

Store or transmit the encrypted image.

The result is typically a file that looks like noise or gibberish to the human eye.

Decrypt with a secure key.

The original image is restored only when the correct decryption key is used.

üîê Common Encryption Techniques
Method	Description
AES	Symmetric encryption; very fast and widely used for encrypting image data.
RSA	Asymmetric encryption; used more for encrypting the key than the image.
Pixel Shuffling	Randomly rearranging pixel positions based on a key.
Chaotic Maps	Using mathematical chaos to create unpredictable encryption patterns.

üìÇ Example Scenario
Let‚Äôs say you're storing patient X-rays on a cloud server. You:

Encrypt the image with AES before uploading.

Only share the decryption key with authorized doctors.

Anyone intercepting the image sees only scrambled data unless they have the key.
